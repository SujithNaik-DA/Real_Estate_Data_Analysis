# Real_Estate_Data_Analysis

Project: Terro's Real Estate Data Analysis

Situation:
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) for Terro's real estate agency to identify the most relevant features affecting house pricing in Boston.

Task:
- Analyzed a dataset of 506 houses to understand the factors influencing property values, including crime rates, pollution levels, education facilities, and more.

Action:
- Utilized Excel's Data Analysis Tool Pack to perform:
  - Summary statistics analysis to comprehend the data's characteristics.
  - Histogram plotting to visualize the distribution of average house prices (Avg_Price).
  - Computation of a covariance matrix to assess variable relationships.
  - Creation of a correlation matrix to identify strong positive and negative correlations.

Result:
- Identified key insights, including significant correlations between variables.
- Built regression models to predict house prices based on independent variables.
- Determined the significance of factors impacting house prices.
- Contributed to data-driven decision-making for pricing strategies.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in data analysis, statistical tools, and regression modeling, highlighting my ability to derive actionable insights from complex datasets.
